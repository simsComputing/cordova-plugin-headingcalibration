Cordova plugin to check for heading calibration quality

This plugin is still in development. It can be used but it has not been tested for iOS yet. Only for android.

Also, in order to imitate android's behaviour, iOS heading accuracy has been reduced to values between 0 and 3. 
The equations used to reduce the accuracy to those values is quite arbitrary and need to be thought through. 

Do not hesitate to send me a message if you need more precisions on this plugin or if you have certain requests.
